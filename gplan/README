# Some scripts to clean and load CSV data into MySQL database.
#
# Run gplan.sql to create database and tables.
#
# Place the CSV files in data/ and make sure they are readable by all users (o+r)
#
# If the CSV files in data/ are already clean (contents of GPlan_Data.tar from Dropbox)
# there is no need to run cleanCSV.php.
#
# Run PHP CLI to load CSV data into MySQL database with corresponding table names:
# e.g., $php loadDataToMySQL.php

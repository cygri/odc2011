http://opendatachallenge.org/

## Project team

* Local Government Computer Services Board, LGCSB, (main contact: Tim Willoughby)
* Fingal County Council, FCC, (main contact: Dominic Byrne)
* DERI, NUI Galway (main contact: Michael Hausenblas) 

## Initial brainstorming

* Agree to create an all-irish planning app
* Agree to create public repo (github or google code - TBD DERI-internally)
* Agree for LGCSB to host the app/mint URIs
* Front-end/UI/UX can be supported by LGCSB (esp. re design)
* Agree to do it on GAE

## Usage scenarios

* notification (RSS, Twitter), similar to Richard's Galway City Council [app](http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2010/planning-apps/)
* using archived data to enhance insights
* word cloud over the apps per city to visualise focus

## Next steps

* OPEN: Michael to do Twitter integration
* OPEN: Michael to investigate availability of a company register with Tim
* OPEN: Michael to check back with data.gov.uk re vocab
* OPEN: Michael to deploy initial setup (GAE+rdflib)
* OPEN: a cool, catchy name and logo
* OPEN: data import
* OPEN: UI/UX
* OPEN: more ideas re scenarios

At the ODH on 14 May we had a look at the GPlan data. Turns out that the only sensible usage scenario is the notification app. We will focus on this one for the submission (with a target coverage for as many as possible counties/cities).

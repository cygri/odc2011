# Joint submission for ODC2011

http://opendatachallenge.org/

## Project team

* Local Government Computer Services Board, LGCSB, (main contact: Tim Willoughby)
* Fingal County Council, FCC, (main contact: Dominic Byrne)
* DERI, NUI Galway (main contact: Michael Hausenblas) 

## Initial brainstorming

* Agree to create an all-irish planning app
* Agree to create public repo (github or google code - TBD DERI-internally)
* Agree for LGCSB to host the app/mint URIs
* Front-end/UI/UX can be supported by LGCSB (esp. re design)
* Agree to do it on GAE

## Usage scenarios

* notification (RSS, Twitter), similar to Richard's Galway City Council [app](http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2010/planning-apps/)
* using archived data to show history of PA coded in year and status
* word cloud over the apps per city to visualise focus
* provide aggregated statistics concerning PA for all Ireland
* AR/mobile version (such as done for [toilets in Vienna, Austria](http://www.open3.at/2011/05/toilet-map-vienna-augmented-reality-app-basierend-auf-open-data-der-stadt-wien))

## Next steps

* OPEN: Anja to do Twitter integration
* OPEN: Michael to do Google Maps street view concept
* OPEN: Michael to look into QR code for single-PA view
* OPEN: Sarven to do data import
* OPEN: Gofran to do overall page (Irland map select)
* OPEN: Aftab (?) to do catchy stats (?) - high level
* OPEN: a cool, catchy name and logo

At the ODH on 14 May we had a look at the GPlan data. Turns out that the only sensible usage scenario is the notification app. We will focus on this one for the submission (with a target coverage for as many as possible counties/cities).

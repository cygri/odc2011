<h2>What is it good for?</h2> 
<p>
	With this app we want to provide insights into local county and city planning processes in Ireland. We do this by notifying users
	of planning applications that have been submitted in their local area via Twitter as well as enabling exploration
	of planning applications in a street-level view.
</p>
<p>
	Citizens benefit directly from learning about ongoing planning applications and the work of the town or county
	council is made transparent, hence brings citizen closer to their local government. 
	For SMEs in the construction area, the app provide additional insights that might serve as a basis for business decisions.
